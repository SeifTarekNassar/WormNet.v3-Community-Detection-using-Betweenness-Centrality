# WormNet.v3-Community-Detection-using-Betweenness-Centrality


Applying the community detection methods on a real data set to be able to determine the 
applicability of these methods on real data and to determine how community detection is useful in 
real life application. So, testing the previous learned methods on the WormNetv3 is big Biological 
Network of sparse networks which integrates of all data-type-specific networks (CE-CX, CE-GN, 
CE-GT, CE-HT, CE-LC, CE-PG, DM-CX, DM-HT, DM-LC, DR-CX, HS-CX, HS-HT, HS-LC, SC-CC, 
SC-CX, SC-HT, SC-LC, SC-TS) by modified Bayesian integration. Betweenness centrality method 
which is very similar to the GN method was applied at the data set and was able to discover 
communities and relations between genes which can be very important for relating and discovering 
the relations between these genesâ€™ groups. The algorithm was implemented to calculate unweighted 
shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in the network.



WormNetv3 network size is  16347 genes	762822 links
